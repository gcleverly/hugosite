Getting started on this new site. I built this site with Hugo, a static site generator, which I have found very user friendly. My previous site was built with Django, which was very capable but perhaps a little much for my needs. Anyways, I'm excited to use this site to show what I'm working on. My goal is to showcase projects I'm doing across the spectrum, whether they be Software, Electrical, Mechanical, or somewhere in between.
