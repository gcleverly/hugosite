      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a little video that shows my senior design project for my B.S. It&amp;rsquo;s a load carrying robot that had to navigate up an inclined slope, deposit weights in a preconfigured area, and navigate back down the ramp to the starting area.

      <description>Hi! My name is Griffin Cleverly. I&#39;m a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for coding living in Los Angeles. I tend to focus on projects that use Python, especially if they involve data or web development. In my spare time you might find me surfing, hiking, or rooting for UCLA sports teams. I&#39;m into traveling and enjoy talking about everything from the news to sports to food. Take a look at my site and let&#39;s get in contact!</description>

      <description>Getting started on this new site. I built this site with Hugo, a static site generator, which I have found very user friendly. My previous site was built with Django, which was very capable but perhaps a little much for my needs. Anyways, I&amp;rsquo;m excited to use this site to show what I&amp;rsquo;m working on. My goal is to showcase projects I&amp;rsquo;m doing across the spectrum, whether they be Software, Electrical, Mechanical, or somewhere in between.</description>
