      <description>Getting started on this new site. I built this site with Hugo, a static site generator, which I have found very user friendly. My previous site was built with Django, which was very capable but perhaps a little much for my needs. Anyways, I&amp;rsquo;m excited to use this site to show what I&amp;rsquo;m working on. My goal is to showcase projects I&amp;rsquo;m doing across the spectrum, whether they be Software, Electrical, Mechanical, or somewhere in between.</description>
